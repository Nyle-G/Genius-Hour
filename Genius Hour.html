<h2 style="text-align: center;">Research Question: To what extent is the energy crisis really an issue, how does disparity across the world in terms of development affect the severity of this crisis from region to region, and what role does the technological aspect of this issue play in aiding or inflating its threat today?

   <p style="font-size: 20px;"><i>First and foremost, yes, the energy crisis is real, it’s an issue, and it’s not a small one either. Here's why:</i> </p>
   <h3>Introduction:</h3>
   <p style="font-size: 17px; border: 2px solid white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">The energy crisis is an issue that affects 1.6 billion people, a number that hasn’t really changed in “absolute terms” since 1970 (Sapiens). This isn’t a challenge that one nation or even one continent faces, it is, as the name suggests, a worldwide issue that is growing increasingly more prevalent. It’s also important to realize and note that this is an issue that is although connected to global climate change, it is an issue that is entirely separate. </p>
   
   <h3>The Facts:</h3>
   
   <p style="font-size: 17px; border: 2px solid white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">Facts don’t lie, and when you boil it down to just the facts, the magnitude of this issue becomes immediately apparent. According to Sapiens, our current pattern of energy use is simply not environmentally plausible, and over-reliance on fossil fuels already has and will continue to have disastrous consequences. Many may immediately turn to renewable energy energy as the solution, however, with more than two billion people by some estimates still lacking access to one or several types of basic energy services (including electricity, clean cooking fuel, and an adequate means of transportation); not only do renewable energy sources lack the raw energy production to be a viable replacement for fossil fuels but providing energy <i>cheaply</i> for these billions of people in developing nations is a far more pressing issue. 
</p>
  
  <h3>Developing Countries:</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; border: 2px solid white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">Thus, the challenge within developing nations is not only a different issue altogether than for developed nations, but far more complicated. Whereas developed nations are now working towards more sustainable and environmentally sound forms of energy production, developing nations have to first prioritize simply providing energy to the billions of people across the world that still lack basic energy access.  As a result, the energy challenge within developing nations is two-fold: How do you convince cashed-stripped developing nations with millions of people who desperately need basic energy access, to transition to far more costly renewable energy production over conventional (and significantly cheaper) fossil fuels?

  <h3>Developed Nations:</h3>
  <div style="border: 2px solid white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
  <p style="font-size: 17px;">
  The U.S. is among the most if not the most developed nation in the world, making it a good example of energy production in highly developed nations. Here’s the breakdown of U.S. Energy Consumption based on statistics pulled from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s website. 
  <br>
  <br>
Fossil Fuels account for about roughly 68% of all U.S. Energy Production. Despite being a nation that has poured resources upon resources into helping remove fossil fuels, ⅔ of U.S. Energy still comes from Fossil Fuels. Here’s the breakdown on how it’s split between various fossil fuels:  
  <ul>
  	<li>Coal = 33%</li>
  	<li>Natural Gas = 33%</li>
  	<li>Petroleum = 1%</li>
  	<li>Other gases = 1%</li>
  </ul>

<div style="border: 3px solid white; border-radius: 10px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 30px;">
   <p style="font-size: 20px;"><i>My First Idea:</i></p>
   
   <ol>
   <li></li><p style="font-size: 17px">In energy production with fossil fuels, the efficiency of a given plant is measured by the “heart rate”. This is calculated by the amount of energy used by an electrical generator or power plant to generate one kWh. Another important measure of a power plant’s capability is its "net generation," which is the amount of electricity a power plant supplies to power transmission lines connected, or the amount of energy it’s producing factoring in energy costs a plant has to run. In fact, this is important, as to produce power, a plant must first put in power to begin with. In fact, the convential power plant utilizes about 7% of its own energy for its own operations. While that may not seem sigificant on the surface, this is actually quite a sigificant amount when put in context to the amount of energy a convential plant is generating to begin with. This is where my first idea comes into play.</p>
  
 <br>
 
   <p style="font-size: 17px;">According to Charlie Wind, a peer of mine who has spent hours researching the efficiency of solar panels and solar energy in general as an energy source; solar energy is a highly viable method of producing energy, however, doesn’t have the sheer energy production that fossil fuels does for energy production. As a result, my first idea is that solar energy, a energy source that has also according to Mr. Wind become significantly cheaper and more affordable can be used to help offset the energy production costs fossil fuels already has. As a cost-effective upgrade to any modern day plant, it will help maintain the massive energy production that only fossil fuels are really capable of in modern times while still making it cleaner and more environmentally sound by increasing efficiency and net generation. </p>
    </ol>

   <p style="font-size: 20px;"><i>My Second Idea: </i></p>
   <ol>
   <li style="color:#20B2AA; font-size: 0.00000001px;"></li>
   <br>
   <li></li>
   <img src="fossil_fuel.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 10px solid white">
   <br>
   <p style="font-size: 17px;">As can be seen in this diagram, the primary function of any fossil fuel in energy production is to be a heat source through which steam is produced and then a turbine is spun creating electrical currents. In fact, one of the great inefficiencies of fossil fuel energy production is the sheer number of conversions the energy goes through before finally being able to be utilized. The burning of a fossil fuel changes chemical energy to heat/thermal energy, which is converted to kinetic energy through the creation of steam, and then the steam to turbine converts kinetic energy to mechanical. At each conversion crucial energy is lost. </p>
   
  <br>
  
   <p style="font-size: 17px;">In order to help combat this issue, I have devised a possible solution again using solar energy. Solar energy is produced with the use of one crucial similarity to fossil fuels: heat. My idea is to create a hybrid method of energy production that can be applied to any existing fossil fuels plant to again help increase efficiency. Since the creation of heat and therefore steam is the key principle behind fossil fuel energy production, I propose using solar panels as another source of heat that could operate in tandem with fossil fuels and boost efficiency (theoretically) by a significant amount. </p>
